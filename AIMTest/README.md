# About

You are a part of a new development team that is supplying an API (over http) that will be used by multiple dependent teams. 
It is your task to design the API and implement a minimal set of code that the other teams can use to test their integration. 
Unblocking those teams by creating the interface is more important than building a complete set of business logic.

# Features

You are tasked with designing an API for an elevator control system. Your API needs to account for the following scenarios:

- A person requests an elevator be sent to their current floor
- A person requests that they be brought to a floor
- An elevator car requests all floors that it’s current passengers are servicing (e.g. to light up the buttons that show which floors the car is going to)
- An elevator car requests the next floor it needs to service
